# Shalini's Corner — Static Site (with Menu Photos)

Photos are now supported for each menu item.

## Add/Replace Photos

- Keep the same filenames (e.g., `chicken-biryani.jpg`) **or** update the `img` path for each item in `assets/js/app.js`.

## Where to Edit
- **Menu & Photos:** `assets/js/app.js` — each item has an `img` field.
- **Open Days:** `typicalOpenDays` inside `assets/js/app.js`.
- **About / Contact / Payments:** `index.html`.
